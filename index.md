## 1 When will Silksong come out?
### 1.1 What a red "No" does to a human beeing
Day 1197
#### 1.1.2
```c++
#include <iostream>
enum class News{
    Yes,
    Maybe,
    Kinda,
    No
};

std::string yipee(News n) {
    if (n == News::No){
        return "no yipee";
    }
    if (n == News::Maybe || n == News::Kinda){
        return "yipee";
    }
    return "YIPEEE";
}

int main() {
    News n = News::Yes;
    std::string yipee(News n);
    std::cout << yipee(n);
    return 0;
}
```
### 1.2 Clowns
Mostly used in context of games beeing released, but not Silksong. Sad.

- [x] complete Hollow Knight with 112%
- [x] think about how good Hollow Knight was
- [x] watch moosbag's videos for more content
